                                that permits the purchase and sale of your Mutant Ape / NFT, provided that the
                                marketplace cryptographically verifies
                                each Mutant Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mutant Ape to ensure that
                                only the actual owner can display

                                the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the

                                merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of

                                be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the

                                generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape

                                Mutant Apes generally, provided that
                                the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape
                                owner’s rights to display the Art for
                                their Mutant Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided

                                the foregoing.

                                any financial transactions that you engage in will be
                                conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight into or control
                                over these payments or
                                transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. We will have no
                                liability to you or to any third
                                party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you
                                engage or any other transactions
                                that you conduct via the Ethereum network.
                                B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every
                                transaction that occurs on the Ethereum
                                network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum
                                network. This means that you
                                will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.</p>
